# sk8ts-ansible

The Ansible roles in this repository are used by sk8ts to install Kubernetes into AWS.

Please note that this is currently pre-Alpha software. Also, it is meant to be used with the [sk8ts-ami](https://github.com/sk8ts/sk8ts-ami) image which has cached versions of various software, such as Kubernetes. The sk8ts-ami will consume this repository and it is currently unlikely that this repository would be used in a standalone fashion.
